@nicolas-grekas I would rather make symfony/symfony conflict with Flex for flex-enabled versions rather than having the Flex having this conflict.
The actual conflict is on symfony/symfony side: the fullstack package is not flex-enabled while components are, and so you loose the Symfony configuration features when using the fullstack.
